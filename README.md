# Person of Interest
Person of Interest is an American science fiction crime drama. [Checkout the show!](https://www.netflix.com/title/70197042) It's one of the closest TV shows to my heart. Here, I have some python codes that try to emulate the face recognition function of _The Machine_ with the help of this [face recognition api for Python](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition). Make sure to check that out too!

Here is an example output :
